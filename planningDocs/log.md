# Development Log

## 2025-01-27 15:29:57 HST - Phase 1 Planning

### Initial Structure and Approach
We'll start with the simplest possible implementation that demonstrates the core functionality:

1. Basic Structure:
   - Single HTML file (index.html)
   - Single JavaScript file (app.js)
   - Inline CSS for simplicity in phase 1
   - Hard-coded data array for initial testing

2. Why This Approach:
   - Minimizes initial complexity
   - Allows quick testing and validation
   - No build tools required for phase 1
   - Can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages
   - Provides a solid foundation for adding features

### Next Steps:
1. Create basic file structure:
   ```
   /
   ├── index.html
   ├── app.js
   └── README.md
   ```

2. Implement core features in order:
   - Basic table display
   - Search functionality
   - View toggle (normal/transposed)

3. Testing:
   - Local testing via simple HTTP server
   - Test across different browsers
   - Validate mobile responsiveness

4. Initial GitHub Pages deployment:
   - Create repository
   - Push initial working version
   - Set up GitHub Pages

This approach allows us to:
- Get immediate feedback on core functionality
- Validate the basic user experience
- Identify any fundamental issues early
- Have a working demo to share quickly

Questions to resolve before proceeding:
1. Should we include any CSS framework for faster styling?
2. Do we want to implement the search using Fuse.js immediately or start with basic filtering?
3. Should we set up any basic testing framework from the start?

## 2025-01-27 15:32:27 HST - Phase 1 Implementation Decisions

### Decisions Made:
1. Testing Approach: Python's built-in HTTP server (simplest option)
   - No additional dependencies needed
   - Works on any machine with Python installed
   - Single command to start

2. Styling: Custom CSS Framework
   - Keep full control over styling
   - No external dependencies
   - Start minimal, expand as needed
   - Focus on readability and responsiveness

3. Search Implementation: Fuse.js
   - Better search experience from the start
   - Simple to implement
   - Flexible for future enhancements

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Create the basic file structure:
   ```
   comparison/
   ├── index.html      # Main HTML file with inline CSS
   ├── app.js          # JavaScript with Fuse.js integration
   └── README.md       # Basic setup instructions
   ```

2. Test locally using Python's HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:8000

This gives us the fastest path to a working prototype while maintaining good practices.

## 2025-01-27 15:38:58 HST - UI Enhancements

### New Features to Implement:

### Implementation Plan:
1. Update button text and styling
2. Add new controls section with:
   - Service visibility toggles
   - Attribute visibility toggles
3. Enhance table headers with:
   - Click-to-sort functionality
   - Visual indicators for sort state
   - Priority sorting for boolean values

These changes will improve the tool's usability while maintaining its clean interface.

   - Add ability to reorder rows in normal view
   - Maintain order state between view changes
   - Use HTML5 Drag and Drop API for native performance

### Implementation Approach:
1. Service Column:
   - Remove from attribute toggles
   - Create fixed first column styling
   - Update rendering logic to always include service

2. Drag and Drop:
   - Add drag handles to headers and rows
   - Implement drag events and visual feedback
   - Store and maintain custom order
   - Sync order between normal and transposed views
